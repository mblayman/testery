Backend
=======

Falcon
------

I want something lean, mean, and straight forward.
Falcon seems to fit that bill.
There is some risk that it does too little
and is too new to have an ecosystem,
but I think it has a solid future.
And it's so minimal that if I'm wrong,
I should be able to replace without ripping all my hair out.

SQLAlchemy
----------

I want to use an ORM and I don't hate myself.

Gunicorn
--------

For development, this will serve as a WSGI server.
This might quickly go away
after I can get the full Vagrant setup going.

JSON
----

I should look for a fast JSON library.
simplejson might work
but there might be better options.
