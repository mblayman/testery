Ember
-----

I'm going to base the client off of Ember.
They recently hit a solid 2.0
and they really seem to have their act together.
The docs are good
and ember-cli seems really powerful.

I know Jasmine for testing,
but the Ember defaults are probably fine.

My biggest unknown is how Ember will play with D3.js.
I'm almost positive this is a solved problem.
It might even play super well with components.

Pure
----

My CSS skills are not what they used to be
and that stuff has changed like crazy.
For now, I like the simplicity of Pure.
Perhaps I'm totally wrong about it.

Sass
----

When I do have to customize CSS,
I choose Sass over Less.

Asset pipeline
--------------

I think Ember handles all this.
I need to read more about docs in ember-cli.
